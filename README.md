Deepfake video detection using transfer learning

# Introduction
The detection of manipulated visual content in photos and videos has become a broader area of research in both academia and society. Photos and videos are both used as a medium for mass communication within the society for both malicious and useful information. These mediums are also considered critical and reliable in legal cases. However, recent advancement in sophisticated technologies has made it easier to manipulate these mediums to create seemingly realistic fake content of high quality.

# Datasource
The dataset used for analysis is the Deep Fake Detection Dataset provided by Google in collaboration with Jigsaw maintained under FaceForensic++ repository. The dataset contains over 3000 manipulated videos from 28 actors in various scenes.

# Results
The transfer learning model based on InceptionResNetV2 was able to achieve a frame classification accuracy of 73.77% and video classification accuracy of 78.89% on test data
